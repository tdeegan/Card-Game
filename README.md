# Card-Game

This program determines the expected value of a card game in which you randomly draw from a standard deck with the following rules:

   1. Black card is worth $1
   2. Red card is worth -$1
   3. You can quit at any time.

It employes elements of dynamic programming with a recursive solution and allows for the user to input a hypothetical situation in the game.
